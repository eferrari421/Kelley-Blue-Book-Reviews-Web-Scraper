Drives excellent, has the right amount of power, gets >30mpg, and handles well.  Has every feature I really need.

I fell in love with the civic and was originally expecting to get an LX base model which is what we had on the CRV. But mom wanted me to have honda sensing. I now have the EX model which also has the sport feature in it. It's a really fun car to drive and I havent had any problems with it. It drives like a dream and everything works.

My body hardly moved as those seats kept me intact with the full air bags that went off.  PS. I also couldn't see after the airbags went off to steer the car so I had to use my imagination.

27,Used 2016 Audi A3,nashvilleitalian,13,0,"""Detailed review of 2019 A3 Quattro AWD""","So I’ve had my 2019 Audi A3 Quattro AWD for a few weeks now. Here are the things I love, and things I wish I could change. 

Things I love:
-Acceleration/speed/driving experience 
-Premium sound system (best feature of the car)
-WiFi built in plus wireless charging 
-The virtual cockpit (amazing when displaying Google Maps)

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

31,Used 2016 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes. 

Overall a solid affordable car!Read less","Fun to Drive, Great MPG, Practical, Sport Shift",Maintenance Costs,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

I went from a full size SUV (Escalade) to a tiny A3 - a bit of a shocker initially but I'm past that.

My daily commute is about 50 miles round trip some on freeways and parts in heavy traffic.  I'm averaging just above 45 mpg which is pretty good compared to the EPA estimates (and my Escalade at 14mpg).

Car is quite luxurious and well bolted together.  I'd far rather have the A3 than a similarly frugal Golf or Jetta even if it would be a little cheaper.Read less","MPG, interior and general quality",No standard reversing camera,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

39,Used 2016 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

49,Used 2016 Audi A3,Jgolden,13,5,"""Solid Feel, Comfortable, Elegant, Confident""","I've had my A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for 7 months and 15000 miles.  First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.  This is NOT a big car, and it is not designed to haul growing families and bulky cargo, but I've used it to haul tons of beach gear, dogs, bark mulch, shovels, concrete landscaping pavers, you name it.  A car is still a tool, after all!   As a final point,  my dealer experiences have been superb, with super modern and clean facilities, car wash service, and great staff.Read less","Traction, handling, elegant design, interior feel",Interior storage cubbies are too small,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

59,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,DannyK,4,1,"""Black Beauty, is the best car I've ever owned""","The only drawbacks, with this car, which I feel are minimal, is that it came with no spare tire, the trunk is slightly smaller, and the rear seats don't fold down.  After hitting a sink hole, in the winter of 2017, damaging both the right front tire, and blowing out my right rear tire, on a restricted highway, on a cold winter night, I bought a donut spare tire, with tire changing tools, both manual, and powered, which fit in the trunk, after removing the utility tray, and compressor provided, in the well below.  This car does get excellent mileage, in just about all situations.  I have put on over 46000 miles, since purchasing this car, in April 2017.  Mostly highway miles.  The large fuel capacity gives this car excellent range.  This car rides very well, is extremely comfortable, holds the road very well, has plenty of power, and has very easy access to both the front, and rear seats.  All of the electronics, and there is plenty, operate flawlessly.  The CVT simulates a real geared transmission very well.  Since there is a great deal that can eventually go wrong with this car, I bought, through Honda, an extended warranty, since I've obviously already passed the conventional 36,000 total car warranty mileage..css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Comfort, reliability, mileage, range, handling","No spare, smaller trunk, non fold down rear seats",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

62,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,Lighting Engineer,5,0,"""Hybrid fuel economy depends on outside temperature""","For those who have focused on good or poor fuel economy of the Accord Hybrid, it all depends on the exterior temperature.  I too bought my car in January and was disappointed by the fuel economy of 38 MPG until the weather became moderate.  Once daily temperatures averaged above 60 F or so, it has become very easy to obtain rated MPG values if driving moderately.  Cold weather is the worst enemy of a hybrids, or in particular, Honda hybrids.  When it is cold, the small engine has to run much more to maintain operational temperatures for the engine system.  When the heater is used, heat energy is removed from the heater core, thus cooling the engine, thus causing it to run more.  Seat heaters drain the battery.  In the winter, more lighting is used by the car, draining the battery.  Draining the battery starts the engine sooner.  My average MPG in my second winter of usage is again about 35-40 MPG for most trips.  I believe this is not too much higher than the efficiency of the 4-cylinder engine, since that would dictate the least efficient state of the car.  (and by comparison, the standard 2017 Accord 2.5L engine does about 38 MPG on the highway)  I can commonly obtain 50 MPG travel both in town and on the highway up to 70 MPH when the weather is between 60 F and 90 F.  Just today, April 1st 2019, I took a short 2 mile trip and averaged 60 MPG.  I averaged 40-50 MPG on my other trips in town today.  Outdoor temperatures were around 65 F and the engine generally only ran when I moderately used the accelerator.  All in all, hybrids probably come closer to obtaining ideal MPG values in warmer climates, not cold climates.  Even the air conditioner in the summer does not use nearly as much energy in the summer as the combined need of the engine to run to maintain operational temperatures and run the heater core.  Additionally, HWY driving in cold temperatures is made worse by the higher density of cold air.  Driving 75+ MPH in sub freezing temperatures will also kill fuel economy.  Plus, all the cold air rushing into the engine bay cools the engine off even quicker on the highway, necessitating the need to run the engine more to maintain operational temperatures.  Honda hybrids sort of love hot days since the engine will always stay warm.  There should be more information published stating the deficiency of cold weather on hybrid systems.  To note, the Accord hybrid LOVES cruising at 45-50 MPH on a warm day...it will run on EV from stop light to stop light, only running the engine when accelerating.  I also had a 2015 Accord with the V6 engine and it did not care what the exterior temperature was.  The V6 engine was the limiting factor on the car efficiency.  While an EXCELLENT and very efficient V6 engine, it dictated the car's efficiency more than aerodynamics or air density did or the accessories running inside the car.  Overall, I actually averaged 27 MPG in that car, which was 1 MPG over the average for that engine.  That was partly because I used that car for a lot of highway driving at 75+ MPH.  When I use my 2017 hybrid for a lot of highway driving over 75+ MPH, economy sinks no matter the temperature.  In the end, I expect my 2017 Accord Hybrid to average about 39 MPG over the life of the car.  That is 12 MPG better than the V6 and about 6 MPG better than the average rating of the 2.5L engine.  I got my Accord Hybrid Touring new at a great clearance price after the 2018's were released, just about $200 more than the list price of a EX-L 4-cylinder, so I think the car does great overall on economy in that respect.  I have no premium cost to recoup.  I just wish it had a full trunk and fold down seats....Read less","Design, driving performance, quality","Smaller trunk, no rear seat folddown, seat comfort",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

It is exceptionally comfortable, holds it's value, is very efficient, is well equipped, and is extremely easy to drive.  I call her Black Beauty, due to her being black, both inside and out.  Due to the fact that the hybrid batteries are in the trunk, I had to sacrifice some trunk space, but there is still adequate storage space.  The safety systems are very accurate, and extremely efficient.  The only thing I don't have is low speed adaptive cruise control, below 25 miles per hour, but frankly, I prefer control of my car at lower speed anyway.  Another short coming on this car was the lack of a spare tire, which I purchased a compact spare myself, and I was able to set up the trunk to easily accommodate it.  Another short coming is not being able to fold the rear seats down, but these short comings are far over shadowed by the numerous advantages this car.  I drive this car primarily on the highway, with my wife, and have found the mileage to be amazing.  The large gas tank makes for less fill ups.  The ride is extremely comfortable, with this car holding the road very well, and absorbing the bumps.  Getting in and out of this car, both front and rear, is very easy, which was one of the major reasons I bought it, in the first place.  Since I took the Touring version of this Accord Hybrid, I have every feature, that I could possibly have, for a 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid.  This is an absolutely amazing vehicle, with easy access, being very safe, reliable, comfortable, and efficient.

This car, which I have named Black beauty, due to it's black leather interior, as well as it's black exterior, is the best car I have ever owned, and I am very pro American.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring has more than enough power, averaging 40 miles per gallon, with mostly highway driving.  Every time I fill her up, I have over 600 miles of range, due to the combination of her high mileage per gallon, and large gas tank.  Because the builders, Honda, wanted to get the best fuel economy, there was no spare tire, or tools, for a tire change, in this car, when I purchased her, only having a compressor, under the trunk's main storage.  I therefore, pulled out the compressor, with it's storage compartment, and put a compact spare there, with tools, which included a car powered hydraulic jack, and a drill type wrench, for the lugs, along with conventional tools, as well, as back up.  The trunk is slightly smaller, than a conventional 2017 Honda Accord trunk, because of the hybrid battery storage, but it is adequate.  The combination of a 2 liter engine, with 2 electric motors, gives this car 212 hp, which packs a good punch, and the CVT transmission it is paired with works like a conventional transmission, and is an excellent pairing, for this power plant.  My car came with large efficient Michelin tires, that hold the road extremely well, and driving this car, is a breeze.  Comfort is excellent, for all seats, front and rear.  Since this is the top of the line, Touring version, it has all the bells and whistles, for the 2107 model, which all perform flawlessly, and are much more than adequate.  I have put almost 32,000 miles, on Black Beauty, in less than 2 years, and have had no problems, with any of it's components, which speaks extremely well, for Honda technology, and reliability.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid was built completely in Japan, unlike conventional Accords, which are built in America, which also speaks extremely well, for Japanese car building.  American car companies can learn a great deal, from this Japanese car, and really should.

111,Used 2017 Audi A3,nashvilleitalian,13,0,"""Detailed review of 2019 A3 Quattro AWD""","So I’ve had my 2019 Audi A3 Quattro AWD for a few weeks now. Here are the things I love, and things I wish I could change. 

Things I love:
-Acceleration/speed/driving experience 
-Premium sound system (best feature of the car)
-WiFi built in plus wireless charging 
-The virtual cockpit (amazing when displaying Google Maps)

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

115,Used 2017 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes. 

Overall a solid affordable car!Read less","Fun to Drive, Great MPG, Practical, Sport Shift",Maintenance Costs,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

I went from a full size SUV (Escalade) to a tiny A3 - a bit of a shocker initially but I'm past that.

My daily commute is about 50 miles round trip some on freeways and parts in heavy traffic.  I'm averaging just above 45 mpg which is pretty good compared to the EPA estimates (and my Escalade at 14mpg).

Car is quite luxurious and well bolted together.  I'd far rather have the A3 than a similarly frugal Golf or Jetta even if it would be a little cheaper.Read less","MPG, interior and general quality",No standard reversing camera,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

123,Used 2017 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

133,Used 2017 Audi A3,Jgolden,13,5,"""Solid Feel, Comfortable, Elegant, Confident""","I've had my A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for 7 months and 15000 miles.  First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.  This is NOT a big car, and it is not designed to haul growing families and bulky cargo, but I've used it to haul tons of beach gear, dogs, bark mulch, shovels, concrete landscaping pavers, you name it.  A car is still a tool, after all!   As a final point,  my dealer experiences have been superb, with super modern and clean facilities, car wash service, and great staff.Read less","Traction, handling, elegant design, interior feel",Interior storage cubbies are too small,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep. If you want an honest opinion save your money, do your research( there is tons of information online about the issues with the soy based wiring) and go get yourself another car.

I'm so sorry I did. It's mostly due to the incredibly uncomfortable seating. I dread my 45 minute commute to work. The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate. Normally I keep my cars for 12 - 14 years but not this one. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it now. PS: the smaller care battery in the trunk died after only 2 weeks.

I kept the car 6 months. I had it back to the dealership/shop 5 times in 6 MONTHS. The problems ranged from serious to stupid.

I disliked the economy setting on the car. I disliked the level of engine noise and the size of the gas tank. I disliked having to waste an entire day to take it into the shop to have something as simple as a taillight replacement. And yes, I tried to have it done locally, but there were no directions, no indicators on the lights and even my local auto parts store wouldn't touch it.

And on it goes. I traded the car for a C Class with almost 30,000 miles on it compared to 7,000 on my CLA. I took a huge hit on the money too.

But I was never so glad to get rid of the CLA and drive away in my C Class.

195,Used 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA,Doug,5,2,"""Best Car I Have Ever Owned""","My 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is my favorite car that I have ever owned! I have always been happy with the value of Mercedes-Benz vehicles as they seem to maintain a strong value per cost as time goes by. Further, it is typically hard to find any AMG at under $100,000 sticker price. Even with some of the added features on mine, the sticker price did come in under $100k when new (Note: I purchased it as a Certified Pre-Owned as I do with all of my vehicles). Thus, I give it a 10/10 for value. 

In terms of reliability, I gave it a 10/10 as I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Granted I have only had it about one month, but all was perfect so far (knock on wood lol).

In terms of Quality, again a 10/10 as the car even has a look of strength, power and durability. Mercedes-Benz always does a great job (IMO) of ensuring their vehicles are of the highest quality!

Driving Dynamics - simply amazing! The car launches like a bullet in quick acceleration and corners beautifully. The suspension shifts the weight in proper proportions in any situation/condition. 10/10

The design I gave a 9/10 but that is being very nit-picky. I would have given it a 10/10 if it were not for the design of the COMAND system. The location of the knob/wheel to control it, is in a location where it is very easy to accidentally bump. Maybe moving it closer to the center would help (touchscreen would be nice too). Also, the cup holders are very small (I drink Fiji water and it is hard to fit it in the cup holders - also part of that is due to the dumb square design of Fiji bottles lol). The exterior design is beautiful! The illuminated star would be my only gripe. It is not very bright and difficult to understand when it is on and when it is not (does not flash with the headlights, etc).  

Comfort and Convenience I also gave 9/10 being very nit-picky. The mBrace 2 system/options are simply amazing. The in-vehicle internet is dial-up modem speed (ahhhh lol). Also, I have owned a 2012 C300 which seemed to have some nice features/options I do not have on this one (Gracenote music, etc.). Also convenient would be if the back-up camera had a front view as well (and even side views - my wife's Infiniti EX35 has this) and audible sensors could also be helpful but again these are not ""complaints"" - simply the only things missing for a 10/10. ;-)

Sport mode lets you drive in a spirited fashion, where comfort mode really reduces the power and will drive as a completely different car. The navigation system is weird, and not user friendly, as some other controls are as well, but once you get used to them, its not an issue. 

The only complaint/warning I would give potential buyers is about the $2250 optional sport recaro racing seats. This is advertised as a significant optional item and it is, but I will tell you that they are not a comfort seat. It will take you a long time to adjust it in every which way you can to get comfortable. I have finally found some seating positions that are comfortable, but nothing like other car seats. On the positive side of these seats, they really grip you and keep you planted in the seat when you are driving fast and taking corners fast as well.

They sit very low to the ground so getting in and out will be a problem for people with back problems. Also, if you’re over 6’ tall you won’t be comfortable sitting in the car. Also, the 1.5 turbo engine has turbo lag which can be annoying. The CVT transmission is not my favorite and I wish Honda had used another tranny instead but not the 10 speed as is found in the 2.0 turbo models as those have had issues. Interior wise I’m very impressed with the dash layout and there are lots of soft touch materials. Trunk space is more than adequate which is a plus, as are the back seats. The car is the best handling one I’ve ever owned. The steering wheel feel is amazing. Yes there is some road noise but it doesn’t bother me and the car (at least mine) has a pretty smooth ride. The new design of the new 2018 thru 2020 is either you love it or hate it. I particularly like the fastback look. Gas milage is good in around town driving (I’m getting 22mpg) and even better on the highway (34mpg).

This vehicle is fairly quick, plus gets fantastic fuel economy - total recorded average of 38.1 mpg (60% city).  Great compromise between comfort and sporty handling, with a few trips up winding mountain roads to prove it. Not only does it handle the switchbacks, the 1.5T is unaffected by the 9000 ft elevation, and the refined CVT does not continually hunt for the right 'gear'.   
As for the safety suite, I have mixed feelings.  The Lane Keep is not as accurate or consistent as other brands.  Adaptive Cruise is OK but takes getting used to.

217,2019 Honda Accord,Long Commutes,3,0,"""One of the best values on the road""","I've had my 2018 Accord Sport for a year now. I commute 160 miles each day so I'm  already approaching 40K miles. I've had many Honda's and enjoyed them all, but this is the first one to feel like I got a lot more car for the money. I get bored with cars easily, but a year later I can't imagine ever replacing this. The quality of the finish inside and out was reminiscent of my wife's Mercedes ML350. The dash layout and infotainment are finally updated and look on par with the best out there. The seats are firm but comfortable most of the time. Back seat leg room is huge! 

When selecting the Accord, I knew I was going to put a ton of miles on it, so MPG and cost of maintenance was important. The Sport is rated at 35MPG highway, and I routinely exceed 40+. Services have been reasonably priced and have come approx every 10K miles. The only item that will cost me soon is replacing the tires. Being 19"" rims and low profile, I anticipate spending upwards of $1000.  My only real complaint is that there is A LOT of road noise. I'm hoping a good quality set of replacement tires will help that. I've had a few issues with the Apple CarPlay that the dealer hasn't been able to fix so I've just lived with it. It's missing a couple of key features like remote start and blind spot monitor, but I discovered if you buy a Honda remote with the remote start button on it and have it programmed to your vehicle, remote start will function. 

Bottom line: I've driven a lot of cars in this class and the Accord is by far the best. It's almost on par with European cars that are $20K more. It's comfy, fast, stylish and yet practical. 40K miles later and I still look forward to getting in it every morning.Read less","MPG, Style, Value, Comfort, Driving Dynamics",Lots of road noise.

Overall, the car has a really nice interior, strong engine, nice tech features and sound system, comfortable seating, and decent handling. I am so very sorry, however, that I leased a car from Audi in 2019, however. Just days after taking this car home I called the dealer to bring it in for service. The car seems to drift on concrete roadways, which is very unnerving. I live in southern California, where many of the freeways and other main roadways are paved in concrete. For whatever reason, the 2019 vehicles just don't stay put on the road and tend to drift left or right. This does not inspire confidence in driving the car at higher speeds, and it tends to make me not want to drive the car other than for short drives. It's such a huge disappointment for a car that costs as much as it does. The dealer has not been able to address the issue and even Audi's customer service did not offer any resolution or even apology.

At highway speeds this thing is so quite it gives you the false impression that you are not going as fast as you are. Several times in the first few months i looked down and saw i was pushing 90+ mph and quickly slowed down. I did find there is a way to set a warning when you pass a certain speed and it will alert you.
On curvy roads it is even better as it takes just about anything you can throw at it with predictability, and youd have to do something pretty stupid to get this thing sideways as it tracks right where you point it and the quattro gives unbelievable grip.
Fit and finish are top notch and even after all these miles i still grin as i head toward this car for a long drive and fire up the virtual cockpit for my next adventure.

Overall, the exterior styling is traditional but sharp and the LED lights help to accent. Inside, the cabin is well appointed - especially on Premium Plus and Prestige models with the upgraded tech package. Performance is good - especially on Quattro models. Sometimes the transmission exhibits a slight hesitation when starting from a stop and occasionally between 1st and second, especially when in slow traffic for long durations. I personally like how the car can wear many hats - business/professional, daily driver, and sport driver. Plenty of space in the front seats - easy to accommodate very tall people. Decent rear seat space given the front seats are not all the way back. Trunk will hold several large boxes or the typical items and golf clubs. Fuel economy is as estimated - even a little better in light traffic and highway driving sometimes. While the EPA estimates for the Premium Plus 2.0 T model is 24/31 MPG, I can get 31 on an around town trip with light traffic. I have gotten as much as 39 MPG on flat interstates when traveling less than 75 MPH. The only other drawbacks are the steering can be a little light in terms of feedback and the cupholders are slightly too far forward under the dash to accommodate very large or tall drinks. Overall, considering price, appearance and efficiency - this car is definitely at the top of its class.

As a former A4 owner (2011 model), I can honestly say that driving performance, use of tech and interior finishes have reached a new level for this model. The car's interior is simply exquisite, the driving performance has improved considerably with additional power, a dual clutch transmission and paddle shifters for a sporty experience, and the inclusion of state of the art driver assistance features make this car a pleasure to drive. Also gets credit for having cured some of the glaring omissions in previous models (such as the lack of Bluetooth streaming in the 2011 model). The only downside is that, at least my model, had an issue with the passenger mirror that the dealership took 4 visits to correct. Also, the Apple Carplay integration is flakey, but I can't honestly say whether it is an Apple problem or an issue on the Audi side. Notwithstanding these two items, I am extremely pleased with the vehicle and would recommend it confidently.Read less","Exquisite finishes, very polished, great tech.",Some tech can have issues.,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep. If you want an honest opinion save your money, do your research( there is tons of information online about the issues with the soy based wiring) and go get yourself another car.

I'm so sorry I did. It's mostly due to the incredibly uncomfortable seating. I dread my 45 minute commute to work. The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate. Normally I keep my cars for 12 - 14 years but not this one. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it now. PS: the smaller care battery in the trunk died after only 2 weeks.

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

313,Used 2016 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes.

321,Used 2016 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.  This is NOT a big car, and it is not designed to haul growing families and bulky cargo, but I've used it to haul tons of beach gear, dogs, bark mulch, shovels, concrete landscaping pavers, you name it.  A car is still a tool, after all!

344,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,Lighting Engineer,5,0,"""Hybrid fuel economy depends on outside temperature""","For those who have focused on good or poor fuel economy of the Accord Hybrid, it all depends on the exterior temperature.  I too bought my car in January and was disappointed by the fuel economy of 38 MPG until the weather became moderate.  Once daily temperatures averaged above 60 F or so, it has become very easy to obtain rated MPG values if driving moderately.  Cold weather is the worst enemy of a hybrids, or in particular, Honda hybrids.  When it is cold, the small engine has to run much more to maintain operational temperatures for the engine system.  When the heater is used, heat energy is removed from the heater core, thus cooling the engine, thus causing it to run more.  Seat heaters drain the battery.  In the winter, more lighting is used by the car, draining the battery.  Draining the battery starts the engine sooner.  My average MPG in my second winter of usage is again about 35-40 MPG for most trips.  I believe this is not too much higher than the efficiency of the 4-cylinder engine, since that would dictate the least efficient state of the car.  (and by comparison, the standard 2017 Accord 2.5L engine does about 38 MPG on the highway)  I can commonly obtain 50 MPG travel both in town and on the highway up to 70 MPH when the weather is between 60 F and 90 F.  Just today, April 1st 2019, I took a short 2 mile trip and averaged 60 MPG.  I averaged 40-50 MPG on my other trips in town today.  Outdoor temperatures were around 65 F and the engine generally only ran when I moderately used the accelerator.  All in all, hybrids probably come closer to obtaining ideal MPG values in warmer climates, not cold climates.  Even the air conditioner in the summer does not use nearly as much energy in the summer as the combined need of the engine to run to maintain operational temperatures and run the heater core.  Additionally, HWY driving in cold temperatures is made worse by the higher density of cold air.  Driving 75+ MPH in sub freezing temperatures will also kill fuel economy.  Plus, all the cold air rushing into the engine bay cools the engine off even quicker on the highway, necessitating the need to run the engine more to maintain operational temperatures.  Honda hybrids sort of love hot days since the engine will always stay warm.  There should be more information published stating the deficiency of cold weather on hybrid systems.  To note, the Accord hybrid LOVES cruising at 45-50 MPH on a warm day...it will run on EV from stop light to stop light, only running the engine when accelerating.  I also had a 2015 Accord with the V6 engine and it did not care what the exterior temperature was.  The V6 engine was the limiting factor on the car efficiency.  While an EXCELLENT and very efficient V6 engine, it dictated the car's efficiency more than aerodynamics or air density did or the accessories running inside the car.  Overall, I actually averaged 27 MPG in that car, which was 1 MPG over the average for that engine.  That was partly because I used that car for a lot of highway driving at 75+ MPH.  When I use my 2017 hybrid for a lot of highway driving over 75+ MPH, economy sinks no matter the temperature.  In the end, I expect my 2017 Accord Hybrid to average about 39 MPG over the life of the car.  That is 12 MPG better than the V6 and about 6 MPG better than the average rating of the 2.5L engine.  I got my Accord Hybrid Touring new at a great clearance price after the 2018's were released, just about $200 more than the list price of a EX-L 4-cylinder, so I think the car does great overall on economy in that respect.  I have no premium cost to recoup.

It is exceptionally comfortable, holds it's value, is very efficient, is well equipped, and is extremely easy to drive.  I call her Black Beauty, due to her being black, both inside and out.  Due to the fact that the hybrid batteries are in the trunk, I had to sacrifice some trunk space, but there is still adequate storage space.  The safety systems are very accurate, and extremely efficient.  The only thing I don't have is low speed adaptive cruise control, below 25 miles per hour, but frankly, I prefer control of my car at lower speed anyway.  Another short coming on this car was the lack of a spare tire, which I purchased a compact spare myself, and I was able to set up the trunk to easily accommodate it.  Another short coming is not being able to fold the rear seats down, but these short comings are far over shadowed by the numerous advantages this car.  I drive this car primarily on the highway, with my wife, and have found the mileage to be amazing.  The large gas tank makes for less fill ups.  The ride is extremely comfortable, with this car holding the road very well, and absorbing the bumps.  Getting in and out of this car, both front and rear, is very easy, which was one of the major reasons I bought it, in the first place.

This is an absolutely amazing vehicle, with easy access, being very safe, reliable, comfortable, and efficient.  Except for what I consider very minor short comings, this is the best car, I have ever owned.Read less","Reliable, Efficient, Comfortable, Easy Access.","No spare tire, a smaller trunk.",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

348,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,Dannyk9411,0,0,"""This is the best car, I have ever owned.""","This car is extremely reliable, efficient, comfortable, and easy to drive.  This car, which I have named Black beauty, due to it's black leather interior, as well as it's black exterior, is the best car I have ever owned, and I am very pro American.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring has more than enough power, averaging 40 miles per gallon, with mostly highway driving.  Every time I fill her up, I have over 600 miles of range, due to the combination of her high mileage per gallon, and large gas tank.  Because the builders, Honda, wanted to get the best fuel economy, there was no spare tire, or tools, for a tire change, in this car, when I purchased her, only having a compressor, under the trunk's main storage.  I therefore, pulled out the compressor, with it's storage compartment, and put a compact spare there, with tools, which included a car powered hydraulic jack, and a drill type wrench, for the lugs, along with conventional tools, as well, as back up.  The trunk is slightly smaller, than a conventional 2017 Honda Accord trunk, because of the hybrid battery storage, but it is adequate.  The combination of a 2 liter engine, with 2 electric motors, gives this car 212 hp, which packs a good punch, and the CVT transmission it is paired with works like a conventional transmission, and is an excellent pairing, for this power plant.  My car came with large efficient Michelin tires, that hold the road extremely well, and driving this car, is a breeze.  Comfort is excellent, for all seats, front and rear.  Since this is the top of the line, Touring version, it has all the bells and whistles, for the 2107 model, which all perform flawlessly, and are much more than adequate.  I have put almost 32,000 miles, on Black Beauty, in less than 2 years, and have had no problems, with any of it's components, which speaks extremely well, for Honda technology, and reliability.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid was built completely in Japan, unlike conventional Accords, which are built in America, which also speaks extremely well, for Japanese car building.  American car companies can learn a great deal, from this Japanese car, and really should.  I'm really impressed, and extremely pleased, with my purchase, and have really put her to the test.Read less","Reliability, Comfort, Ride, Style, Power, Mileage.","No spare tire, smaller trunk.",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

The gas mileage, is very good, averaging over 40 miles per gallon on all trips regardless of how much highway driving I have to do.  I especially like the two screen viewing system, and its easy access, to both the front and back seats.  The only drawbacks are that it has a relatively small trunk, 13.5 cu. ft., no auto cruise under 25 miles per hour, and does not come with a spare tire, having a compressor instead.  I find the infotainment system easy to use.

The good: Looks nice, comfortable seats, lane assist and smart cruise, and the right signal camera.

The bad: Poor gas mileage, two warranty repairs (back deck where speakers are held had to be removed and adjusted due to rattling and the steering wheel air bag had to be removed and repacked for a rattle deep inside, the trunk/storage space is almost unacceptable, Apple car play or the entertainment system is glitchy, there are no knobs for the entertainment system which is a pain, and the engine is really loud when idling.

393,Used 2017 Audi A3,nashvilleitalian,13,0,"""Detailed review of 2019 A3 Quattro AWD""","So I’ve had my 2019 Audi A3 Quattro AWD for a few weeks now. Here are the things I love, and things I wish I could change. 

Things I love:
-Acceleration/speed/driving experience 
-Premium sound system (best feature of the car)
-WiFi built in plus wireless charging 
-The virtual cockpit (amazing when displaying Google Maps)

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

397,Used 2017 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes.

I went from a full size SUV (Escalade) to a tiny A3 - a bit of a shocker initially but I'm past that.

My daily commute is about 50 miles round trip some on freeways and parts in heavy traffic.  I'm averaging just above 45 mpg which is pretty good compared to the EPA estimates (and my Escalade at 14mpg).

Car is quite luxurious and well bolted together.  I'd far rather have the A3 than a similarly frugal Golf or Jetta even if it would be a little cheaper.Read less","MPG, interior and general quality",No standard reversing camera,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

Bang and Olfsun sound system is incredible! Couldn't believe it's a factory system.

A recall was issued for quick disconnect fuel lines in the engine bay that may cause a fire. My VIN checked out okay.  Check this out before buying if possible :)

405,Used 2017 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

415,Used 2017 Audi A3,Jgolden,13,5,"""Solid Feel, Comfortable, Elegant, Confident""","I've had my A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for 7 months and 15000 miles.  First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.  This is NOT a big car, and it is not designed to haul growing families and bulky cargo, but I've used it to haul tons of beach gear, dogs, bark mulch, shovels, concrete landscaping pavers, you name it.  A car is still a tool, after all!   As a final point,  my dealer experiences have been superb, with super modern and clean facilities, car wash service, and great staff.Read less","Traction, handling, elegant design, interior feel",Interior storage cubbies are too small,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep. If you want an honest opinion save your money, do your research( there is tons of information online about the issues with the soy based wiring) and go get yourself another car.

The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate.

I kept the car 6 months. I had it back to the dealership/shop 5 times in 6 MONTHS. The problems ranged from serious to stupid.

I disliked the economy setting on the car. I disliked the level of engine noise and the size of the gas tank. I disliked having to waste an entire day to take it into the shop to have something as simple as a taillight replacement. And yes, I tried to have it done locally, but there were no directions, no indicators on the lights and even my local auto parts store wouldn't touch it.

And on it goes. I traded the car for a C Class with almost 30,000 miles on it compared to 7,000 on my CLA. I took a huge hit on the money too.

But I was never so glad to get rid of the CLA and drive away in my C Class.

477,Used 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA,Doug,5,2,"""Best Car I Have Ever Owned""","My 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is my favorite car that I have ever owned! I have always been happy with the value of Mercedes-Benz vehicles as they seem to maintain a strong value per cost as time goes by. Further, it is typically hard to find any AMG at under $100,000 sticker price. Even with some of the added features on mine, the sticker price did come in under $100k when new (Note: I purchased it as a Certified Pre-Owned as I do with all of my vehicles). Thus, I give it a 10/10 for value. 

In terms of reliability, I gave it a 10/10 as I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Granted I have only had it about one month, but all was perfect so far (knock on wood lol).

In terms of Quality, again a 10/10 as the car even has a look of strength, power and durability. Mercedes-Benz always does a great job (IMO) of ensuring their vehicles are of the highest quality!

Driving Dynamics - simply amazing! The car launches like a bullet in quick acceleration and corners beautifully. The suspension shifts the weight in proper proportions in any situation/condition. 10/10

The design I gave a 9/10 but that is being very nit-picky. I would have given it a 10/10 if it were not for the design of the COMAND system. The location of the knob/wheel to control it, is in a location where it is very easy to accidentally bump. Maybe moving it closer to the center would help (touchscreen would be nice too). Also, the cup holders are very small (I drink Fiji water and it is hard to fit it in the cup holders - also part of that is due to the dumb square design of Fiji bottles lol). The exterior design is beautiful! The illuminated star would be my only gripe. It is not very bright and difficult to understand when it is on and when it is not (does not flash with the headlights, etc).  

Comfort and Convenience I also gave 9/10 being very nit-picky. The mBrace 2 system/options are simply amazing. The in-vehicle internet is dial-up modem speed (ahhhh lol). Also, I have owned a 2012 C300 which seemed to have some nice features/options I do not have on this one (Gracenote music, etc.). Also convenient would be if the back-up camera had a front view as well (and even side views - my wife's Infiniti EX35 has this) and audible sensors could also be helpful but again these are not ""complaints"" - simply the only things missing for a 10/10. ;-)

Sport mode lets you drive in a spirited fashion, where comfort mode really reduces the power and will drive as a completely different car. The navigation system is weird, and not user friendly, as some other controls are as well, but once you get used to them, its not an issue. 

The only complaint/warning I would give potential buyers is about the $2250 optional sport recaro racing seats. This is advertised as a significant optional item and it is, but I will tell you that they are not a comfort seat. It will take you a long time to adjust it in every which way you can to get comfortable. I have finally found some seating positions that are comfortable, but nothing like other car seats. On the positive side of these seats, they really grip you and keep you planted in the seat when you are driving fast and taking corners fast as well.

Also, the 1.5 turbo engine has turbo lag which can be annoying. The CVT transmission is not my favorite and I wish Honda had used another tranny instead but not the 10 speed as is found in the 2.0 turbo models as those have had issues. Interior wise I’m very impressed with the dash layout and there are lots of soft touch materials. Trunk space is more than adequate which is a plus, as are the back seats.

This vehicle is fairly quick, plus gets fantastic fuel economy - total recorded average of 38.1 mpg (60% city).  Great compromise between comfort and sporty handling, with a few trips up winding mountain roads to prove it. Not only does it handle the switchbacks, the 1.5T is unaffected by the 9000 ft elevation, and the refined CVT does not continually hunt for the right 'gear'.

I've had many Honda's and enjoyed them all, but this is the first one to feel like I got a lot more car for the money. I get bored with cars easily, but a year later I can't imagine ever replacing this. The quality of the finish inside and out was reminiscent of my wife's Mercedes ML350. The dash layout and infotainment are finally updated and look on par with the best out there. The seats are firm but comfortable most of the time. Back seat leg room is huge! 

When selecting the Accord, I knew I was going to put a ton of miles on it, so MPG and cost of maintenance was important. The Sport is rated at 35MPG highway, and I routinely exceed 40+. Services have been reasonably priced and have come approx every 10K miles. The only item that will cost me soon is replacing the tires. Being 19"" rims and low profile, I anticipate spending upwards of $1000.  My only real complaint is that there is A LOT of road noise. I'm hoping a good quality set of replacement tires will help that. I've had a few issues with the Apple CarPlay that the dealer hasn't been able to fix so I've just lived with it. It's missing a couple of key features like remote start and blind spot monitor, but I discovered if you buy a Honda remote with the remote start button on it and have it programmed to your vehicle, remote start will function. 

Bottom line: I've driven a lot of cars in this class and the Accord is by far the best. It's almost on par with European cars that are $20K more. It's comfy, fast, stylish and yet practical. 40K miles later and I still look forward to getting in it every morning.Read less","MPG, Style, Value, Comfort, Driving Dynamics",Lots of road noise.

The Premium plus has excellent LED headlights, so much better than the 3 series. With the headlights on a side shining LED light turns on with the turn signals lighting up the side of the road you're turning into. The 2.0t  Engine is one of the best in the industry, it's a gem with excellent toque pulls and pulls. I get 25 MPGs in town and 39 highway, so much better than I expected. The digital dash is also excellent, you can have the GPS screen right in front of you clear and so easy to read. Sit behind the wheel and instantly you know you're in something special, start driving and everything feels right. I always tell people to drive the car you're interested at night, headlights are so important, sadly even some top brands have poor headlights. The base A4 headlights aren't as good as the Premium Plus or prestige models. Audi should put the best headlight in EVERY model .

Overall, the car has a really nice interior, strong engine, nice tech features and sound system, comfortable seating, and decent handling. I am so very sorry, however, that I leased a car from Audi in 2019, however. Just days after taking this car home I called the dealer to bring it in for service. The car seems to drift on concrete roadways, which is very unnerving. I live in southern California, where many of the freeways and other main roadways are paved in concrete. For whatever reason, the 2019 vehicles just don't stay put on the road and tend to drift left or right. This does not inspire confidence in driving the car at higher speeds, and it tends to make me not want to drive the car other than for short drives. It's such a huge disappointment for a car that costs as much as it does. The dealer has not been able to address the issue and even Audi's customer service did not offer any resolution or even apology. This will be my last Audi purchase, unfortunately I am stuck with it now for the remainder of the lease.Read less","Strong acceleration, confident braking, interior",Upsetting handling,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

At highway speeds this thing is so quite it gives you the false impression that you are not going as fast as you are. Several times in the first few months i looked down and saw i was pushing 90+ mph and quickly slowed down. I did find there is a way to set a warning when you pass a certain speed and it will alert you.
On curvy roads it is even better as it takes just about anything you can throw at it with predictability, and youd have to do something pretty stupid to get this thing sideways as it tracks right where you point it and the quattro gives unbelievable grip.
Fit and finish are top notch and even after all these miles i still grin as i head toward this car for a long drive and fire up the virtual cockpit for my next adventure.
Although decidedly skewed towards highway miles my lifetime mpg is 33 mpg which is 2 greater than stated on the Monroney sticker.

527,Used 2017 Audi A4,Nick,15,1,"""Great entry level sedan""","I purchased this vehicle shortly after it began shipping to the US. I am very pleased with it so far, only a few small cons. Overall, the exterior styling is traditional but sharp and the LED lights help to accent. Inside, the cabin is well appointed - especially on Premium Plus and Prestige models with the upgraded tech package. Performance is good - especially on Quattro models. Sometimes the transmission exhibits a slight hesitation when starting from a stop and occasionally between 1st and second, especially when in slow traffic for long durations. I personally like how the car can wear many hats - business/professional, daily driver, and sport driver. Plenty of space in the front seats - easy to accommodate very tall people. Decent rear seat space given the front seats are not all the way back. Trunk will hold several large boxes or the typical items and golf clubs. Fuel economy is as estimated - even a little better in light traffic and highway driving sometimes. While the EPA estimates for the Premium Plus 2.0 T model is 24/31 MPG, I can get 31 on an around town trip with light traffic. I have gotten as much as 39 MPG on flat interstates when traveling less than 75 MPH. The only other drawbacks are the steering can be a little light in terms of feedback and the cupholders are slightly too far forward under the dash to accommodate very large or tall drinks. Overall, considering price, appearance and efficiency - this car is definitely at the top of its class. While this car has broad appeal - it is definitely a car for young professionals, especially in business and technology fields.Read less","Appearance, fit & finish, technology","Cup holder placement, transmission hesitation",https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

My prior A6 now seems old and behind the times in regards to design. The 017 A4 is like a mobile business office and allows on to do a host of things with an Apple IPHONE due to seamless integration with software due to Audi Car Play. One can give voice commands for sending texts and the system is flawless in regards to taking voice to text for messages and all done without taking the hands off the steering wheel. The A4 in Prestige edition with the driving assistance package does not provide autonomous driving yet provides a host of safety features that enhance driving on both the highway and inner city. Performance is sport with nice steering input and road holding characteristics with a 4 liter that strains a bit yet surprisedly, almost meets the acceleration of my prior A6 (3.0 liter). I am impressed by mileage getting overall 28.4 mpg on all around driving and up to 35 mpg on strict highway driving cruising at 70 mph. I have the Quattro system and with winter tires the car performs exceptionally in all types of snow conditions. Fit and finish is top notch with excellent construction and a very ergonomically designed interior that is intuitive to operate. Probably one of the best entry, small luxury 4 door sedans that one can buy considering the technology that has been thrown into this vehicle. I have read reviews that exterior design is not evolving radically and quickly enough to please those whom think a new car design should be a radical departure from prior designs. This is simply the Audi way, yet one needs to know years down the line your vehicle will not look old or outdated. I think the exterior design is classic and refined.Read less","Technology beyond others in this segment, comfort","Small glove box, placement of cupholders",https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

The car's interior is simply exquisite, the driving performance has improved considerably with additional power, a dual clutch transmission and paddle shifters for a sporty experience, and the inclusion of state of the art driver assistance features make this car a pleasure to drive. Also gets credit for having cured some of the glaring omissions in previous models (such as the lack of Bluetooth streaming in the 2011 model). The only downside is that, at least my model, had an issue with the passenger mirror that the dealership took 4 visits to correct.

The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep.

I'm so sorry I did. It's mostly due to the incredibly uncomfortable seating. I dread my 45 minute commute to work. The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate. Normally I keep my cars for 12 - 14 years but not this one. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it now. PS: the smaller care battery in the trunk died after only 2 weeks. I may never buy a Toyota again - they have lost my good opinion.Read less",Steering and pick up are good.,Incredibly uncomfortable seats and headrests.,https://www.kbb.com//toyota/camry-hybrid/2018/consumer-reviews/

Things I love:
-Acceleration/speed/driving experience 
-Premium sound system (best feature of the car)
-WiFi built in plus wireless charging 
-The virtual cockpit (amazing when displaying Google Maps)

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

595,Used 2016 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes.

603,Used 2016 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

613,Used 2016 Audi A3,Jgolden,13,5,"""Solid Feel, Comfortable, Elegant, Confident""","I've had my A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for 7 months and 15000 miles.  First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.  This is NOT a big car, and it is not designed to haul growing families and bulky cargo, but I've used it to haul tons of beach gear, dogs, bark mulch, shovels, concrete landscaping pavers, you name it.  A car is still a tool, after all!   As a final point,  my dealer experiences have been superb, with super modern and clean facilities, car wash service, and great staff.Read less","Traction, handling, elegant design, interior feel",Interior storage cubbies are too small,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2016/consumer-reviews/

623,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,DannyK,4,1,"""Black Beauty, is the best car I've ever owned""","The only drawbacks, with this car, which I feel are minimal, is that it came with no spare tire, the trunk is slightly smaller, and the rear seats don't fold down.  After hitting a sink hole, in the winter of 2017, damaging both the right front tire, and blowing out my right rear tire, on a restricted highway, on a cold winter night, I bought a donut spare tire, with tire changing tools, both manual, and powered, which fit in the trunk, after removing the utility tray, and compressor provided, in the well below.  This car does get excellent mileage, in just about all situations.  I have put on over 46000 miles, since purchasing this car, in April 2017.  Mostly highway miles.  The large fuel capacity gives this car excellent range.  This car rides very well, is extremely comfortable, holds the road very well, has plenty of power, and has very easy access to both the front, and rear seats.  All of the electronics, and there is plenty, operate flawlessly.  The CVT simulates a real geared transmission very well.  Since there is a great deal that can eventually go wrong with this car, I bought, through Honda, an extended warranty, since I've obviously already passed the conventional 36,000 total car warranty mileage..css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Comfort, reliability, mileage, range, handling","No spare, smaller trunk, non fold down rear seats",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

626,Used 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid,Lighting Engineer,5,0,"""Hybrid fuel economy depends on outside temperature""","For those who have focused on good or poor fuel economy of the Accord Hybrid, it all depends on the exterior temperature.  I too bought my car in January and was disappointed by the fuel economy of 38 MPG until the weather became moderate.  Once daily temperatures averaged above 60 F or so, it has become very easy to obtain rated MPG values if driving moderately.  Cold weather is the worst enemy of a hybrids, or in particular, Honda hybrids.  When it is cold, the small engine has to run much more to maintain operational temperatures for the engine system.  When the heater is used, heat energy is removed from the heater core, thus cooling the engine, thus causing it to run more.  Seat heaters drain the battery.  In the winter, more lighting is used by the car, draining the battery.  Draining the battery starts the engine sooner.  My average MPG in my second winter of usage is again about 35-40 MPG for most trips.  I believe this is not too much higher than the efficiency of the 4-cylinder engine, since that would dictate the least efficient state of the car.  (and by comparison, the standard 2017 Accord 2.5L engine does about 38 MPG on the highway)  I can commonly obtain 50 MPG travel both in town and on the highway up to 70 MPH when the weather is between 60 F and 90 F.  Just today, April 1st 2019, I took a short 2 mile trip and averaged 60 MPG.  I averaged 40-50 MPG on my other trips in town today.  Outdoor temperatures were around 65 F and the engine generally only ran when I moderately used the accelerator.  All in all, hybrids probably come closer to obtaining ideal MPG values in warmer climates, not cold climates.  Even the air conditioner in the summer does not use nearly as much energy in the summer as the combined need of the engine to run to maintain operational temperatures and run the heater core.  Additionally, HWY driving in cold temperatures is made worse by the higher density of cold air.  Driving 75+ MPH in sub freezing temperatures will also kill fuel economy.  Plus, all the cold air rushing into the engine bay cools the engine off even quicker on the highway, necessitating the need to run the engine more to maintain operational temperatures.  Honda hybrids sort of love hot days since the engine will always stay warm.  There should be more information published stating the deficiency of cold weather on hybrid systems.  To note, the Accord hybrid LOVES cruising at 45-50 MPH on a warm day...it will run on EV from stop light to stop light, only running the engine when accelerating.  I also had a 2015 Accord with the V6 engine and it did not care what the exterior temperature was.  The V6 engine was the limiting factor on the car efficiency.  While an EXCELLENT and very efficient V6 engine, it dictated the car's efficiency more than aerodynamics or air density did or the accessories running inside the car.  Overall, I actually averaged 27 MPG in that car, which was 1 MPG over the average for that engine.  That was partly because I used that car for a lot of highway driving at 75+ MPH.  When I use my 2017 hybrid for a lot of highway driving over 75+ MPH, economy sinks no matter the temperature.  In the end, I expect my 2017 Accord Hybrid to average about 39 MPG over the life of the car.  That is 12 MPG better than the V6 and about 6 MPG better than the average rating of the 2.5L engine.  I got my Accord Hybrid Touring new at a great clearance price after the 2018's were released, just about $200 more than the list price of a EX-L 4-cylinder, so I think the car does great overall on economy in that respect.  I have no premium cost to recoup.  I just wish it had a full trunk and fold down seats....Read less","Design, driving performance, quality","Smaller trunk, no rear seat folddown, seat comfort",https://www.kbb.com//honda/accord-hybrid/2015/consumer-reviews/

It is exceptionally comfortable, holds it's value, is very efficient, is well equipped, and is extremely easy to drive.  I call her Black Beauty, due to her being black, both inside and out.  Due to the fact that the hybrid batteries are in the trunk, I had to sacrifice some trunk space, but there is still adequate storage space.  The safety systems are very accurate, and extremely efficient.  The only thing I don't have is low speed adaptive cruise control, below 25 miles per hour, but frankly, I prefer control of my car at lower speed anyway.  Another short coming on this car was the lack of a spare tire, which I purchased a compact spare myself, and I was able to set up the trunk to easily accommodate it.  Another short coming is not being able to fold the rear seats down, but these short comings are far over shadowed by the numerous advantages this car.  I drive this car primarily on the highway, with my wife, and have found the mileage to be amazing.  The large gas tank makes for less fill ups.  The ride is extremely comfortable, with this car holding the road very well, and absorbing the bumps.  Getting in and out of this car, both front and rear, is very easy, which was one of the major reasons I bought it, in the first place.  Since I took the Touring version of this Accord Hybrid, I have every feature, that I could possibly have, for a 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid.  This is an absolutely amazing vehicle, with easy access, being very safe, reliable, comfortable, and efficient.

This car, which I have named Black beauty, due to it's black leather interior, as well as it's black exterior, is the best car I have ever owned, and I am very pro American.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring has more than enough power, averaging 40 miles per gallon, with mostly highway driving.  Every time I fill her up, I have over 600 miles of range, due to the combination of her high mileage per gallon, and large gas tank.  Because the builders, Honda, wanted to get the best fuel economy, there was no spare tire, or tools, for a tire change, in this car, when I purchased her, only having a compressor, under the trunk's main storage.  I therefore, pulled out the compressor, with it's storage compartment, and put a compact spare there, with tools, which included a car powered hydraulic jack, and a drill type wrench, for the lugs, along with conventional tools, as well, as back up.  The trunk is slightly smaller, than a conventional 2017 Honda Accord trunk, because of the hybrid battery storage, but it is adequate.  The combination of a 2 liter engine, with 2 electric motors, gives this car 212 hp, which packs a good punch, and the CVT transmission it is paired with works like a conventional transmission, and is an excellent pairing, for this power plant.  My car came with large efficient Michelin tires, that hold the road extremely well, and driving this car, is a breeze.  Comfort is excellent, for all seats, front and rear.  Since this is the top of the line, Touring version, it has all the bells and whistles, for the 2107 model, which all perform flawlessly, and are much more than adequate.  I have put almost 32,000 miles, on Black Beauty, in less than 2 years, and have had no problems, with any of it's components, which speaks extremely well, for Honda technology, and reliability.  This 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid was built completely in Japan, unlike conventional Accords, which are built in America, which also speaks extremely well, for Japanese car building.  American car companies can learn a great deal, from this Japanese car, and really should.

675,Used 2017 Audi A3,nashvilleitalian,13,0,"""Detailed review of 2019 A3 Quattro AWD""","So I’ve had my 2019 Audi A3 Quattro AWD for a few weeks now. Here are the things I love, and things I wish I could change. 

Things I love:
-Acceleration/speed/driving experience 
-Premium sound system (best feature of the car)
-WiFi built in plus wireless charging 
-The virtual cockpit (amazing when displaying Google Maps)

Here is what I am not so thrilled about:
-Cabin space - tiny glovebox, tiny trunk, center console is used up by the wireless charger - SPACE IS LIMITED
-Placement of cupholders - my large Yeti mug is too tall so I have to hold it while driving. Not very safe.. they should have put more thought into this design 
-Biggest pet peeve? I have a $47,000 car with every high end tech option as other model Audi’s (same virtual cock pit, same MyAudi / Audi Connect) yet Audi Corporate Office has refused to unlock “key user” functionality for the 2019 A3 model year!

What does this mean?
-I have a $47,000 vehicle with the same technology as the A4,A5 etc, yet they can use a mobile app to unlock doors, check gas levels, and track their vehicle in the event of theft, yet my A3 has the tech, but a decision by Audi “locks” loyal A3 customers from using very basic remote features due to them not having $50-150,000 MSRP model vehicles. 

Why the hate for the A3 customer community, Audi? 

Guess what I can do with the “MyAudi” app? I can view photos of my vehicle (wow), look at the original equipment installed (double wow) and set service appointments (triple wow). USELESS! 

The funny thing is, I would gladly pay a monthly fee to have a mobile app that actually linked to my vehicle as a key user. 

Maybe Audi will have a heart and push a firmware update that will allow 2019 customers to actually use the 2019 technology they paid a hefty price for to have in their A3’s? Time will tell...

Overall though, it’s not all sour grapes. The A3 Quattro is a beast of a machine and if Audi unlocked basic features for remote monitoring, I would be much happier and less bitter about my $47,000 purchase (when you add local taxes, destination delivery and dealer fees and maintenance / extended warranty, it’s actually a $55,000 purchase - just for the record).css-1h02fnl{-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(127,159,218,.5);-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:#3666BD;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:start;-webkit-justify-content:flex-start;-ms-flex-pack:start;justify-content:flex-start;position:relative;-webkit-transform:translateY(0);-ms-transform:translateY(0);transform:translateY(0);margin-top:8px;}.css-1h02fnl span{cursor:pointer;}.css-1h02fnl span:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}Read less.css-1qs95sv{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin:0;-webkit-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-ms-transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);transform:rotate3d(0,0,1,-180deg);-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .5s;-webkit-transition:transform .5s;transition:transform .5s;}.css-1uff8uj-StyledIcon{color:#000000;height:19px;width:19px;fill:#3666BD;}","Speed, handling, overall driving experience",Remote app control/monitoring disabled in A3s!,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

679,Used 2017 Audi A3,lexieeeee,8,2,"""Most practical car I've ever owned!""","This was my first purchase out of college in 2015, I had a 4 wheel drive Jeep with a huge engine and was looking for something more eco friendly for my beginner's wallet.  I was looking at ""affordable"" cars and stumbled upon this beauty.  It had been owned for 6 months (purchased new) as a fleet vehicle for a company that went under and had 15k miles on it, absolute mint condition basically brand new, but I got a deal because it was sitting at a Honda dealership.   

Firstly, I want to say, I have the ""bottom of the line"" model.  The smallest engine, no upgrades, just the base model...and WOW it still has all the upgrades of most premium domestic cars.  Leather seats, really cool dash set up, power seats, sun roof, etc.  It's a beautiful sleek car inside and out, and still has great pickup and control.

I've owned this car for 4 years now, in a rural area and now a big city.  The practicality of this car has only grown with me.  It's a cute sporty car for young professional, but would also make a practical family car when the time comes.  It's great in a big city, small enough to parallel park anywhere, handles the Boston snow with ease, and stops on a dime in traffic.  Backseat is small, but large enough my 6'4"" dad can fit. I also LOVE that I get anywhere from 35-45 MPG.  On average I'm getting 430 miles on my 11~ gallon tank!

The ONLY downside was going from a domestic car to a German.  General maintenance can be a little pricey, you need a key to open oil pan (can't change yourself), and it takes extra oil during a change, but you can also go twice as long between oil changes per the maintenance guidelines. However, I will say, I have had ZERO issues with the car outside of scheduled maintenance.  I had one recall (I never had an issue but my VIN was on the list) for the fuel sensor, took it to my local Audi and it was switched over in about 20 minutes.

I went from a full size SUV (Escalade) to a tiny A3 - a bit of a shocker initially but I'm past that.

My daily commute is about 50 miles round trip some on freeways and parts in heavy traffic.  I'm averaging just above 45 mpg which is pretty good compared to the EPA estimates (and my Escalade at 14mpg).

Car is quite luxurious and well bolted together.  I'd far rather have the A3 than a similarly frugal Golf or Jetta even if it would be a little cheaper.Read less","MPG, interior and general quality",No standard reversing camera,https://www.kbb.com//audi/a3/2017/consumer-reviews/

687,Used 2017 Audi A3,No Thanks Audi,9,8,"""2018 package pricing is a huge let down!""","I love the S3.  I test drove a few a couple of years ago and almost got one, but I decided to stick with BMW and got my 340i Msport instead.  However, since having the 340i I keep remembering how much I loved the S3.  So, I decided that in 3 years I would get an S3 and do a loan purchase.

So, the 2018 S3 specs and pricing came out and I was excited to build what I want and check the pricing.  I dont get a lot of options in my cars as I dont think most options in Euro, especially German cars, are worth the huge cost.  My wants are a nice auto trans, power leather seats, and a great audio system.

I go to Audis website and try to configure the S3.  I quickly discover that that excellent B&O audio that was about a 950 stand alone option is NO LONGER available as a stand-alone option.  Now, Audi wants me to pay 3,200 more for their technology package, thats full of options I DO NOT need nor want, like navigation and virtual cockpit.  

This of course increases the once reasonable price of a nicely equipped S3 tremendously.  And, the base price has gone up a good amount.  When I priced a 2017 S3 with premium metallic paint and B&O audio the MSRP was
45,375.  For 2018 MSRP is 47,825 because I have to get the tech pkg if I want the B&O audio.

The S3 used to be a great small performance sedan for a decent price.  Now, its a great small performance sedan that costs nearly 50K.  Audi will lose sales with this poorly setup options packaging and increased base price.

I can get a BMW M240i for nearly the same money and it will have a much better resale value when Im ready to sell or trade in 3 to 5 years.

697,Used 2017 Audi A3,Jgolden,13,5,"""Solid Feel, Comfortable, Elegant, Confident""","I've had my A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for 7 months and 15000 miles.  First off, the car is regularly complimented as ""beautiful"".  I am drawn to the classic Audi design. The exterior is smooth, flowing, and gorgeous (there are no tacky fake vents, strange angles, deep creases or other fad-inspired styling gimmicks) and this makes it easy to wash the car by hand!  The interior design is pure calm, with thoughtful matte finishes, real aluminum accents, and controls which feel great to the touch.  All latches and mechanisms feel and sound sturdy.  I find the front seats very comfortable (no aches, no squirming around) even on extended highway trips such as travelling from Texas to Florida.   The overall performance is satisfying, as the 2.0 turbo and all wheel drive make for a confident driving experience.  Tire pressures are supposed to be set at 41 PSI on my model, but 35 PSI provides a greatly improved ride & handling experience.  Around town, with stop and go driving, you may notice the DSG transmission has a slight shudder when letting off the brake pedal...to roll forward... but it is normal and can be completely ignored after a few drives.  Rear seating is decent, but not a priority for the A3 buyer, though rear seat passengers do get their own AC and heater vents... a very nice touch.

The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep. If you want an honest opinion save your money, do your research( there is tons of information online about the issues with the soy based wiring) and go get yourself another car.

I'm so sorry I did. It's mostly due to the incredibly uncomfortable seating. I dread my 45 minute commute to work. The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate. Normally I keep my cars for 12 - 14 years but not this one. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it now. PS: the smaller care battery in the trunk died after only 2 weeks.

I kept the car 6 months. I had it back to the dealership/shop 5 times in 6 MONTHS. The problems ranged from serious to stupid.

I disliked the economy setting on the car. I disliked the level of engine noise and the size of the gas tank. I disliked having to waste an entire day to take it into the shop to have something as simple as a taillight replacement. And yes, I tried to have it done locally, but there were no directions, no indicators on the lights and even my local auto parts store wouldn't touch it.

And on it goes. I traded the car for a C Class with almost 30,000 miles on it compared to 7,000 on my CLA. I took a huge hit on the money too.

But I was never so glad to get rid of the CLA and drive away in my C Class.

759,Used 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA,Doug,5,2,"""Best Car I Have Ever Owned""","My 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is my favorite car that I have ever owned! I have always been happy with the value of Mercedes-Benz vehicles as they seem to maintain a strong value per cost as time goes by. Further, it is typically hard to find any AMG at under $100,000 sticker price. Even with some of the added features on mine, the sticker price did come in under $100k when new (Note: I purchased it as a Certified Pre-Owned as I do with all of my vehicles). Thus, I give it a 10/10 for value. 

In terms of reliability, I gave it a 10/10 as I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Granted I have only had it about one month, but all was perfect so far (knock on wood lol).

In terms of Quality, again a 10/10 as the car even has a look of strength, power and durability. Mercedes-Benz always does a great job (IMO) of ensuring their vehicles are of the highest quality!

Driving Dynamics - simply amazing! The car launches like a bullet in quick acceleration and corners beautifully. The suspension shifts the weight in proper proportions in any situation/condition. 10/10

The design I gave a 9/10 but that is being very nit-picky. I would have given it a 10/10 if it were not for the design of the COMAND system. The location of the knob/wheel to control it, is in a location where it is very easy to accidentally bump. Maybe moving it closer to the center would help (touchscreen would be nice too). Also, the cup holders are very small (I drink Fiji water and it is hard to fit it in the cup holders - also part of that is due to the dumb square design of Fiji bottles lol). The exterior design is beautiful! The illuminated star would be my only gripe. It is not very bright and difficult to understand when it is on and when it is not (does not flash with the headlights, etc).  

Comfort and Convenience I also gave 9/10 being very nit-picky. The mBrace 2 system/options are simply amazing. The in-vehicle internet is dial-up modem speed (ahhhh lol). Also, I have owned a 2012 C300 which seemed to have some nice features/options I do not have on this one (Gracenote music, etc.). Also convenient would be if the back-up camera had a front view as well (and even side views - my wife's Infiniti EX35 has this) and audible sensors could also be helpful but again these are not ""complaints"" - simply the only things missing for a 10/10. ;-) 

Overall I gave it a 10/10 because it is an amazing car! Highly recommended x 1000!! :-)Read less","Fun to drive, beautiful car","navigation not touch screen, no front camera",https://www.kbb.com//mercedes-benz/cla/2016/consumer-reviews/

761,Used 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA,Carnut,39,6,"""Fun Car""","I bought this car a couple of months ago. This car is very fun to drive as the acceleration in sport mode is pretty awesome.  Sport mode lets you drive in a spirited fashion, where comfort mode really reduces the power and will drive as a completely different car. The navigation system is weird, and not user friendly, as some other controls are as well, but once you get used to them, its not an issue. 

The only complaint/warning I would give potential buyers is about the $2250 optional sport recaro racing seats. This is advertised as a significant optional item and it is, but I will tell you that they are not a comfort seat. It will take you a long time to adjust it in every which way you can to get comfortable. I have finally found some seating positions that are comfortable, but nothing like other car seats. On the positive side of these seats, they really grip you and keep you planted in the seat when you are driving fast and taking corners fast as well.

They sit very low to the ground so getting in and out will be a problem for people with back problems. Also, if you’re over 6’ tall you won’t be comfortable sitting in the car. Also, the 1.5 turbo engine has turbo lag which can be annoying. The CVT transmission is not my favorite and I wish Honda had used another tranny instead but not the 10 speed as is found in the 2.0 turbo models as those have had issues. Interior wise I’m very impressed with the dash layout and there are lots of soft touch materials. Trunk space is more than adequate which is a plus, as are the back seats. The car is the best handling one I’ve ever owned. The steering wheel feel is amazing. Yes there is some road noise but it doesn’t bother me and the car (at least mine) has a pretty smooth ride. The new design of the new 2018 thru 2020 is either you love it or hate it. I particularly like the fastback look. Gas milage is good in around town driving (I’m getting 22mpg) and even better on the highway (34mpg).

The brake assist/collision avoidance has randomly activated when nothing is in front of the car.  Two batteries had to be replaced in the first 3 months.

This vehicle is fairly quick, plus gets fantastic fuel economy - total recorded average of 38.1 mpg (60% city).  Great compromise between comfort and sporty handling, with a few trips up winding mountain roads to prove it. Not only does it handle the switchbacks, the 1.5T is unaffected by the 9000 ft elevation, and the refined CVT does not continually hunt for the right 'gear'.   
As for the safety suite, I have mixed feelings.  The Lane Keep is not as accurate or consistent as other brands.  Adaptive Cruise is OK but takes getting used to.

781,2019 Honda Accord,Long Commutes,3,0,"""One of the best values on the road""","I've had my 2018 Accord Sport for a year now. I commute 160 miles each day so I'm  already approaching 40K miles. I've had many Honda's and enjoyed them all, but this is the first one to feel like I got a lot more car for the money. I get bored with cars easily, but a year later I can't imagine ever replacing this. The quality of the finish inside and out was reminiscent of my wife's Mercedes ML350. The dash layout and infotainment are finally updated and look on par with the best out there. The seats are firm but comfortable most of the time. Back seat leg room is huge! 

When selecting the Accord, I knew I was going to put a ton of miles on it, so MPG and cost of maintenance was important. The Sport is rated at 35MPG highway, and I routinely exceed 40+. Services have been reasonably priced and have come approx every 10K miles. The only item that will cost me soon is replacing the tires. Being 19"" rims and low profile, I anticipate spending upwards of $1000.  My only real complaint is that there is A LOT of road noise. I'm hoping a good quality set of replacement tires will help that. I've had a few issues with the Apple CarPlay that the dealer hasn't been able to fix so I've just lived with it. It's missing a couple of key features like remote start and blind spot monitor, but I discovered if you buy a Honda remote with the remote start button on it and have it programmed to your vehicle, remote start will function. 

Bottom line: I've driven a lot of cars in this class and the Accord is by far the best. It's almost on par with European cars that are $20K more. It's comfy, fast, stylish and yet practical. 40K miles later and I still look forward to getting in it every morning.Read less","MPG, Style, Value, Comfort, Driving Dynamics",Lots of road noise.

The car seems to drift on concrete roadways, which is very unnerving. I live in southern California, where many of the freeways and other main roadways are paved in concrete. For whatever reason, the 2019 vehicles just don't stay put on the road and tend to drift left or right. This does not inspire confidence in driving the car at higher speeds, and it tends to make me not want to drive the car other than for short drives. It's such a huge disappointment for a car that costs as much as it does.

I did find there is a way to set a warning when you pass a certain speed and it will alert you.
On curvy roads it is even better as it takes just about anything you can throw at it with predictability, and youd have to do something pretty stupid to get this thing sideways as it tracks right where you point it and the quattro gives unbelievable grip.
Fit and finish are top notch and even after all these miles i still grin as i head toward this car for a long drive and fire up the virtual cockpit for my next adventure.

809,Used 2017 Audi A4,Nick,15,1,"""Great entry level sedan""","I purchased this vehicle shortly after it began shipping to the US. I am very pleased with it so far, only a few small cons. Overall, the exterior styling is traditional but sharp and the LED lights help to accent. Inside, the cabin is well appointed - especially on Premium Plus and Prestige models with the upgraded tech package. Performance is good - especially on Quattro models. Sometimes the transmission exhibits a slight hesitation when starting from a stop and occasionally between 1st and second, especially when in slow traffic for long durations. I personally like how the car can wear many hats - business/professional, daily driver, and sport driver. Plenty of space in the front seats - easy to accommodate very tall people. Decent rear seat space given the front seats are not all the way back. Trunk will hold several large boxes or the typical items and golf clubs. Fuel economy is as estimated - even a little better in light traffic and highway driving sometimes. While the EPA estimates for the Premium Plus 2.0 T model is 24/31 MPG, I can get 31 on an around town trip with light traffic. I have gotten as much as 39 MPG on flat interstates when traveling less than 75 MPH. The only other drawbacks are the steering can be a little light in terms of feedback and the cupholders are slightly too far forward under the dash to accommodate very large or tall drinks. Overall, considering price, appearance and efficiency - this car is definitely at the top of its class. While this car has broad appeal - it is definitely a car for young professionals, especially in business and technology fields.Read less","Appearance, fit & finish, technology","Cup holder placement, transmission hesitation",https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

811,Used 2017 Audi A4,Steve,23,2,"""New Standard of Interior Design and Functionality""","I moved out of my larger 2015 Audi A6 to get in to the new technologies and design of the 2017 A4. My prior A6 now seems old and behind the times in regards to design. The 017 A4 is like a mobile business office and allows on to do a host of things with an Apple IPHONE due to seamless integration with software due to Audi Car Play. One can give voice commands for sending texts and the system is flawless in regards to taking voice to text for messages and all done without taking the hands off the steering wheel. The A4 in Prestige edition with the driving assistance package does not provide autonomous driving yet provides a host of safety features that enhance driving on both the highway and inner city. Performance is sport with nice steering input and road holding characteristics with a 4 liter that strains a bit yet surprisedly, almost meets the acceleration of my prior A6 (3.0 liter). I am impressed by mileage getting overall 28.4 mpg on all around driving and up to 35 mpg on strict highway driving cruising at 70 mph. I have the Quattro system and with winter tires the car performs exceptionally in all types of snow conditions. Fit and finish is top notch with excellent construction and a very ergonomically designed interior that is intuitive to operate. Probably one of the best entry, small luxury 4 door sedans that one can buy considering the technology that has been thrown into this vehicle. I have read reviews that exterior design is not evolving radically and quickly enough to please those whom think a new car design should be a radical departure from prior designs. This is simply the Audi way, yet one needs to know years down the line your vehicle will not look old or outdated. I think the exterior design is classic and refined.Read less","Technology beyond others in this segment, comfort","Small glove box, placement of cupholders",https://www.kbb.com//audi/a4/2017/consumer-reviews/

It has a ton of tech, which is intimidating at first, but is soon found to be mostly intuitive, and none has malfunctioned.

Dealership experience was excellent. I did a LOT of research prior to buying this car. When they upgraded the 2017 model I was instantly down for the count, but it took a few months to pull the trigger.

My car is a heavily loaded Premium Plus, just shy of the Prestige at 49K. It's a lot of money for a car for me, but it's a lot of car for the money. I'm super impressed.

As a former A4 owner (2011 model), I can honestly say that driving performance, use of tech and interior finishes have reached a new level for this model. The car's interior is simply exquisite, the driving performance has improved considerably with additional power, a dual clutch transmission and paddle shifters for a sporty experience, and the inclusion of state of the art driver assistance features make this car a pleasure to drive. Also gets credit for having cured some of the glaring omissions in previous models (such as the lack of Bluetooth streaming in the 2011 model). The only downside is that, at least my model, had an issue with the passenger mirror that the dealership took 4 visits to correct. Also, the Apple Carplay integration is flakey, but I can't honestly say whether it is an Apple problem or an issue on the Audi side.

838,Used 2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid,Ruby2022,9,6,"""Unreliable""","Save yourself the headache and money  I’ve only had this car for one month and it’s been at the shop multiple times. The remote start on the car doesn’t work most of the time and if you don’t click it 3 times fast enough or if the lights won’t blink when you click the remote key, the car won’t turn on (very complicated)You also have to be within a few feet to start,lock,unlock the car( why can’t they put a separate button for the remote start?)   They also have a remote connect app that you can use to turn the car on but that is buggy and it doesn’t work majority or the time either and I was told by a service rep from Toyota that it’s just a software issue and they can’t do anything about it. I believe for the price we are paying, the car should have a front sensor with a beeping sound and automatic stop so you won’t hit whatever is in front of you and a sensor that stops you when you are  backing up (the back only beeps but it doesn’t stop automatically). But the most important thing is the soy-based wires that Toyota uses- these attract rodents and they will chew up all your wires and other stuff In your engine which you will have to pay out of  pocket to replace because Toyota doesn’t cover that in their warranty. This is something that Toyota is aware of and they continue to use this type of wiring. So you get the car fixed and the rodents come back and  chew up the wires again and it’s a non-ending cycle that you are set up to fail because when they make the repairs they use the same wiring (yes, look it up, thousands of Toyota owners have been through this) The Camry also has poor acceleration and they will also try to include the remote connect as part of the vehicle but you have to purchase this separately in order for you to use this option- so don’t get fooled by the sales rep. If you want an honest opinion save your money, do your research( there is tons of information online about the issues with the soy based wiring) and go get yourself another car.

I'm so sorry I did. It's mostly due to the incredibly uncomfortable seating. I dread my 45 minute commute to work. The seats are too bucketed - they make you sit rounded forward and slumped, not straight. They are also difficult to get in and out of. The headrests angle extremely forward so you just cannot sit yourself up straight. The lumbar support is too low and is not actually high enough to reach my lumbar region. As others have mentioned, the doors do not stay open unless you push them out quite far and then you cannot reach them to close them when sitting. Who designed this car? How could it be so bad?  I purchased the XLE so I could have heated side mirrors when I need to drive in the snow which means I spent a lot of money on a car I hate. Normally I keep my cars for 12 - 14 years but not this one. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it now. PS: the smaller care battery in the trunk died after only 2 weeks.
